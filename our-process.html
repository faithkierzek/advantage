        <h2>OUR PROCESS</h2>
        <h3>The Advantage Remodeling Process</h3>

        <h3>DESIGN</h3>
        <p>Once the details are complete and we are moving 
            forward with the design process, Greg will schedule 
            an in-home meeting with all of our trade partners 
            who will collaborate with him on your project. Rather 
            than enduring multiple meetings with several 
            residential general contractors, you’ll only have to do 
            this once. Meeting with our trade partners in this way 
            has several other advantages as well. For example, 
            we’ll receive more accurate proposals and be faced 
            with fewer hiccups because we took this level of care 
            during the planning stage.</p>
        <p>We typically spend a couple of hours in your home 
            taking measurements, inspecting the overall 
            condition of the project area and mechanicals. This is 
            also our opportunity to listen to you and your needs, 
            continuing to build a relationship with you so that 
            you feel good about trusting us with your home.</p>
        <img src="Images/build-icon.png" alt="Build Icon">
        <h3>BUILD</h3>
        <p>Our experience has allowed us to earn certification 
            from the National Association of the Remodeling 
            Industry (NARI). As NARI Certified Kitchen and Bath 
            Remodelers, Certified Remodeling Project Managers, 
            and Certified Lead Carpenters, we have 
            demonstrated our knowledge and can therefore 
            ensure you are totally pleased with your kitchen or 
            bathroom remodeling project.</p>
        <p>We care for your home as though it were our own. 
            This means we take extra care to see that your home 
            remains clean and safe while our technicians perform 
            their work. One way we do this is by sealing off our 
            work areas and ensuring floors and other surfaces 
            are adequately protected.</p>
        <p>Our workers will never leave you with a mess at the 
            end of the day. We carefully clean our work area so 
            that you never have to stumble over tools or 
            construction debris. At Advantage Design + Remodel, 
            we take pride in maintaining a tidy work space. It’s 
            just one more way we remain committed to bringing 
            you exceptional customer service at every turn.</p>
