            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
            <p>Advantage Design + Remodel was founded in 2009 by 
                owners Greg Wade and Andy Schafer, who are also 
                brothers-in-law. Longtime general contractors in their 
                own right, Greg and Andy know the inner workings of 
                a home as well as what it takes to complete a major 
                kitchen, bathroom, addition, basement or even a 
                whole home renovation. They’ve built their own 
                homes and will provide you with the same care and 
                attention to detail when renovating yours.</p>
                <img src="Images/throwback.png" alt="Throwback photo of owners Andy and Greg doing construction work">
                <p>Greg and Andy both share a common goal, to 
                    provide superior home renovations to those in New 
                    Berlin, Milwaukee, Whitefish Bay, Brookfield, Elm 
                    Grove, Wauwatosa, and other nearby cities in 
                    Wisconsin. Don’t struggle with a lack of space, bad 
                    floor plan, poor layout, or an outdated design when 
                    we can easily take care of those problems for you. 
                    Contact us today to see why we are the preferred 
                    general contractors for a number of area residents.</p>

            <h2>WHY REMODEL WITH US?</h2>
            <img src="Images/why-remodel-photo.jpg" alt="Advantage remodeled condo kitchen and living room">
            <P>Your home is your largest, and most 
                important, investment, but it’s more 
                than that. It’s also your safe haven, the 
                place that you and your family feel the 
                most comfortable, secure, and happy. 
                Even so, there are some things that 
                you wish were different. Perhaps the 
                space isn’t quite as modern as you’d 
                like, or there isn’t as much room as 
                your family needs, or it simply doesn’t 
                function as well as you need it to. At 
                Advantage Design + Remodel, we 
                understand that choosing the best 
                remodeling contractor for your next 
                design project can be daunting. After 
                all, every contractor you encounter 
                claims they’re the best in the business 
                and that you should hire them. The 
                truth is, you have to be very careful to 
                choose the right contractor so you get 
                the best results.</P>
