                shower and dual sinks. No matter the complexity or 
                simplicity of your ideas, our team of experienced

            <h3>BASEMENTS</h3>
            <p>Consider embarking on a home project such as 
                remodeling your basement if you find that your 
                house does not have enough room. Plumbing, 
                layout consultation as well as selecting the right 
                materials are essential parts of this process, with 
                professional basement contractors providing these 
                services. This is particularly relevant in the 
                Milwaukee area, known for its mix of city and 
                small-town feel. With the help of a skilled 
                contractor, by opting for basement finishing, you 
                can transform an unfinished basement from a place 
                of storage or shelter during weather emergencies 
                into a beautiful, functional space.</p>

            <h3>ADDTIONS</h3>
            <p>When considering a home addition, hiring a design 
                professional is a pivotal decision. With projects like 
                expanding your living space, renovating a kitchen, or 
                revamping a bathroom, the expertise of a seasoned 
                design-build company like Advantage Design + 
                Remodel becomes invaluable. Their approach to

            <h3>CUSTOM COUNTERTOPS</h3>
            <p>At Advantage Design + Remodel, we understand 
                that the heart of your home lies in the details. With 
                our custom countertop services, we bring the 
                beauty and durability of granite, quartz, and 
                laminate right into the kitchens and baths of 
                homeowners like you. Our dedicated team of 
                designers, installers, and staff work tirelessly to 
                ensure that every step of your countertop 
                installation process is handled with the utmost care.</p>
            <p>Cambria countertops are gorgeous and strong, but 
                those aren’t their only good qualities. We like 
                Cambria because it is an American company, based 
                in Minnesota, and they use materials mined from 
                their own quartz mine which runs entirely on 
                hydroelectric power. Plus, the countertops 
                themselves are NSF 51 certified safe for food 
                preparation. Basically, that means you can rest 
                assured that your kitchen countertops from 
                Cambria are healthy enough to eat off of. The 
                surface is nonabsorbent, which means bacteria and 
                messes can simply be wiped off with a damp cloth 
                and soap. No bad stuff will absorb into the surface. 
                The quality of these natural stone countertops is the 
                finest on the market.</p>
